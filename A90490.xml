            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O satisfie your request in your Letter touching the condition of Leicester, I have endeavoured to enforme my selfe from the most moderate and understanding men that were sufferers in that generall losse, and eye-witnesses of the whole carriage of that sad busines, that are since fled hither for refuge. On Wednesday at night <hi>May</hi> the 28. a strong party of the Kings horse faced the Towne, and by quartering at the adjacent Villages hindred the supplies from the Countrey. On Thursday their Artillery were drawn up neere the Town, and by the direction of some malignants of the town, who had formerly gone out of it, or were put out, their great Guns were planted against some of the weakest places of their workes: by Friday night they made wide breaches, which by the industry of the men and women of the town were some of them made up againe with Wool▪ packs, and other materials; but the enemy pressing hard upon them with their numbers, and that round about the towne they were hard put to it, the enemy being numerous without, and they but few within, and the workes very large; the line is neere three miles in compasse, the foot Souldiers in pay in the towne not exceeding 450, and the townes-men in
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:113024:3"/> armes, with some of the Countrey that came in to their assistance made the souldiary about 1000 in all, who by reason of the small<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of their numbers, and the largenesse of their workes, were enforced to duty Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday nights toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the enemy keeping them in constant alarms, which did so tire out the townes▪ men that they were the more unfit for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ting the furious enemy, though to give them their due they did as much as could be expected considering the opposition, for the enemy had about 4000 foot, who stormed in so many places at once, that the defendants wanting reserves were the ea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ilier over▪ mastered. The storme began about one of the clocke on Satturday morning <hi>May</hi> the 31. and lasted at the walls about two howres, the enemy being all this while strongly resisted and lost many in the worke, they were three times beaten backe, but their horse who were behind the foot did force them on againe, about 20 severall bodies of foot storming at once, 200. or 300. in a place, and driven on by as many horse as oft as they were driven to retreat, and when they did breake in they were by ours driven back<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> againe untill oppressed by multitudes, and entring in many places at once ours were driven to the market-place, where our horse that all this while had backed our foot, and kept them to their duty, now were themselves put to it, and did behave themselves resolutely▪ and held the fight in the Town almost an houre after, betaking themselves to places of strength, enforced quarter for their lives, and some of them escaped, having gotten the enemies word (which was <hi>God and the Prince.</hi>) At their first comming in they slaughtred many, untill ours had laid down their Armes and yeelded them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves prisoners and then they fell to their plundering worke, and catching of men to be their prisoners, executing their accustomed cruelty to men and women to finde out their money, and best goods. The Gentlemen of the Committee, Sir <hi>Robert Py<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> and Major <hi>Enis</hi> were carried before the Princes to their Inne, who disposed them to severall houses as prisoners, the two last upon their Paroll were set at liberty to procure exchange, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee are yet kept prisoners in the towne many other Gentlemen of the Countrey and Officers of the garrison were sent with the best of the plunder to their severall garrisons of Newarke, Litch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field, and Belvore, 140 cart loads of the best goods and wares in
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:113024:3"/> the shops were sent away by Satturday noone towards Newarke with a convoy of horse. I finde some of the Pamphlets speaking of the horrid cruelty of the insulting enemy, putting man, wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and child to the sword. I know their tender mercies are cruelties, but give the divell his due, there was indeed many slaine at the first enterance, and some that made little resistance, and some women and children amongst the multitude by the rabble of common souldiers▪ but I cannot learne of any such order given to destroy all, as is said by some, and it is the generall opinion of many that have since got out of the Towne that in the conflict and since there was not slaine of the Parliaments party, souldiers and others, above 100. and some of those in their cold blood, after they had granted quarter of life, picking out some active men and setting common souldiers to quarrell with them and slay them, but of these not many. It is confidently believed that not above 300 are slaine on both sides, the Town was full of wealth which the Countries had brought in for safety, they tooke their nine peices of Ordnance, great and small, above 1000 Muskets: neere 400 horse and armes, and about 50 Barrells of Powder, besides what was spent in the service. The greatest defect was want of men▪ though the Town was not well fortifyed, nor was there Ordnance to reach from one worke to another; It were to be wished that Garrisons of such concernment to the Kingdome might be taken care off, that they might have at least 1000 foot souldiers in pay, which had this place had, with the helpe of the Townes-men, in all probability that might have kept out the enemy, and made them pay for their bold attempt, Colonell <hi>Hastings</hi> is made Governour there, who now bestirs himselfe in the fortifying the Towne, which if soon visited may in probability yet be regained.</p>
